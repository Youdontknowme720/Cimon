## Usage Guide

### Initial Setup

#### Adding a GitLab Token
1. Navigate to GitLab ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Access Tokens
2. Create a token with `read_api` scope
3. In Cimon, select **+ Add Token**
4. Paste your token and save

#### Adding Projects
1. Find your GitLab project ID (visible in project settings or URL)
2. Select **+ Add Project** in Cimon
3. Enter the numeric **Project ID** 
4. Provide a descriptive **Project Name** for display
5. Save the configuration

### Monitoring Workflows

#### Pipeline Overview
- Select any configured project from the Home screen
- View pipelines with status indicators:
  - ‚úÖ Success - Pipeline completed successfully
  - ‚ùå Failed - Pipeline failed
  - üîÑ Running - Pipeline currently executing
  - ‚è≥ Pending - Pipeline queued for execution
  - ‚èπÔ∏è Canceled - Pipeline was canceled

#### Job Details
1. Select any pipeline to drill down into job details
2. Inspect individual jobs showing:
   - Job status and name
   - Execution stage
   - Runtime duration
3. Select specific jobs for detailed modal view

#### Data Management
- **Refresh**: Press `r` to update pipeline/job data
- **Auto-save**: All configuration changes are saved automatically
- **Loading indicators**: Visual feedback during data fetching

### Navigation Controls

| Key | Action |

## Configuration

Cimon automatically manages configuration in `config.yml` within the application directory.

### Configuration Structure
```yaml
token: "glpat-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
projects:
  - id: 12345678
    name: "Frontend Application"
  - id: 87654321
    name: "API Backend"
  - id: 11223344
    name: "DevOps Tools"
```

### Security Notes
- Store your `config.yml` securely and avoid committing it to version control
- Use GitLab tokens with minimal required permissions (`read_api`)
- Consider using environment-specific tokens for different GitLab instances

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No pipelines found"**
- Verify project ID is correct (numeric identifier from GitLab)
- Ensure your token has `read_api` permissions
- Check if the project has any pipelines

**"Authentication failed"**
- Confirm your GitLab token is valid and not expired
- Verify token permissions include API access
- Test token manually with GitLab API

**"Connection timeout"**
- Check network connectivity to GitLab instance
- Verify GitLab server availability
- Consider firewall or proxy restrictions
